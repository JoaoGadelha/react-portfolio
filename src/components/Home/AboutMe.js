                Hello, my name is Jo√£o Ricardo T. Gadelha. I am a <b className="blue">Fullstack Web Developer</b>.
                <br /><br />
                I'm a <b className="blue">Computer Engineer</b> graduated at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil.
                <br /><br />
                I've started my coding journey with learning the bread and butter of Frontend development, a.k.a <b className="blue">HTML, CSS and Javascript</b> by watching free Youtube tutorials and Traversy Media's Udemy videos.
                <br /> <br />
                Since then I've dedicated myself in developing my frontend and backend skills, mainly developing projects in <b className="blue">React and React Native</b> using <b className="blue">Firebase</b> and <b className="blue">Node.js/Express.js</b> for <b className="blue">User Authentication</b> and <b className="blue">Backend APIs Development</b>.
                <br /><br />
                I am fluent in classics like

                </i>
                <br /><br />
                Until this moment I've worked in two companies developing React Native apps:
